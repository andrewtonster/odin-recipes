    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon thyme chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon rosemary chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon oregano chopped</li>
      <li>2 lean New York Steak strip steaks</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound yukon gold potatoes sliced about Â½ inch in thickness</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add olive oil and
        butter, potatoes, garlic, thyme, rosemary and oregano. Cook for about 3
        minutes, stir and cook and additional 3 minutes or until fork tender.
        Remove and set on a plate.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn the skillet to high heat. Add the steaks. Cook on each side for 3
        minutes or until outside is browned. Reduce heat to medium high. Cook
        the steaks to desired doneness. Mine took about 10 minutes flipping 3
        times to get a medium well.
      </li>

      <li>
        Right before the steaks are done, make the garlic butter compound. Mix
        the butter, garlic and fresh chopped herbs. Slather on top of steaks.
        Add the potatoes back to the pan and heat through and let the butter
        melt into the steaks.
