    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This burger recipe will blow your mind</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pieces white sandwhich bread</li>
      <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
      <li>21/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
      <li>11/2 worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>3 pounds 80 to 85% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>3 scallions</li>
      <li>8 hamburger buns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it
      forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce
      and ketchup and mix well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands.
      Mix everything together until evenly combined. Divide the mixture into 8
      equal portions and form compact balls. Flatten the balls into ¾-inch
      patties about 4½ inches across. Form a slight depression in the center of
      each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned
      on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a
      few minutes more until desired doneness is reached. Before serving, toast
      the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.
    </p>

    <p>
      Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The uncooked burgers can be frozen for up
      to three months. (Freeze the burgers on a baking sheet or plate so their
      shape sets, then transfer them to a sealable plastic bag for easy
      storage.) Defrost the burgers overnight in the refrigerator prior to
      serving and then cook as directed.
